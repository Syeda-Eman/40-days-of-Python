# 1- Headings
How to give headings?
Use a (#) sign and space to make a heading. As the amount of (#) increases the size of the font decreases.
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4

###### Heading 6

This is a normal text in Markdown.

> This is a special block of text. You can make it special by using (>) sign

# 3- Line breaks

This is the first line.
This is the second line.

To give a line break you have to press enter 2 times

In conclusion, you can create line breaks by pressing Enter twice or by using a backslash at the end of the first line.

Italic:
*1 esteric on both sides of the text*
