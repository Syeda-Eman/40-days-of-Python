On day 1 of the course, the mentor explained the basics of Python and the installation process for the software we needed.


Why take this course?

It's a 40-day course which requires no prior knowledge of programming which means it's for beginners.
In this course, we will learn with real-world examples.


Now starting with: What is Data Science?

Data science is the future because "Data is everywhere." Whatever you do on the Internet produces a lot of data, and to make valuable decisions, you need Data Science.

Examples:

Predicting tomorrow's weather involves using data, a process often referred to as "Machine Learning Predictions." 
Similarly, the recommendations you see on various social media apps rely on data to identify patterns in your behaviour. For example, these platforms analyze the types of videos you watch and those you tend to ignore. 
Based on this information, they curate a selection of videos in your feed that you are likely to enjoy. 


To learn data science we are gonna use Python language.
Now why only Python?

The most popular programming language nowadays in the world is Python.

1. Software engineers
2. Scientists
3. Data Analyst
3. Mathematicians
4. Statisticians
5. Accountants
6. Network Engineers

They all use Python!

Python is a futuristic programming language because it is very easy to learn and similar to the human language English.

You also don't need to be a computer scientist or an IT guy to learn it.

It's an open-source and scalable language which is free and available for all.


Where you can use Python?

1. Data Analysis
2. AI and ML
3. Automation
4. Web Apps
5. Mobile Apps
6. Desktop Apps (Software)
7. Software Testing
8. Hacking (Ethical Hacking)

Finally, avoid copying and pasting code. Understanding it and writing it in your own words is far more beneficial.
